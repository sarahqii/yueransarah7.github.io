    about: [
        "Hello! I'm Jeonghyun Kim, a Master's student at the Interactive Computing Lab at KAIST, advised by Professor Uichin Lee. My research lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) and digital well-being, with a focus on designing stress management systems that foster self-awareness.",
        "Currently, I'm working on a research project that explores how we can help people manage stress more effectively. My work involves creating systems that promote self-awareness by supporting both self-reflection and timely intervention, using diverse everyday data such as wearable sensing and mobile usage patterns.",
        "With a background in software engineering and a passion for human-computer interaction (HCI), I aim to create user-centered technologies that support well-being in everyday life. I'm particularly interested in how thoughtful design can make digital systems more empathetic and supportive."
